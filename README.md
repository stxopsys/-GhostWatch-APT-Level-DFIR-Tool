# 🛰️ GhostWatch – APT-Level DFIR Tool

🚨 **Warning**: This tool is highly sensitive — capable of flagging red team implants, stealth APT activity, and advanced memory tampering in real time. Use with surgical intent. Results may reveal what others can't even see.

**GhostWatch** is an operator-grade forensic scanner engineered to expose evasive techniques like section ghosting, remote thread injection, and syscall-level memory tampering — the kind of stuff that slips past antivirus and EDR.

Built to operate like an operator.  
No fluff. No GUI. Just pure telemetry.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔍 **Live detection of:**
  - RWX mappings, erased PE headers, and unbacked memory
  - Section ghosting & Doppelganging artifacts
  - Remote thread injection via `CreateRemoteThread`
  - Direct syscall tampering (`NtWriteVirtualMemory`, etc.)
- 📡 **ETW tracing** with syscall-level event capture
- 🧳 **Portable** – run from USB, no installation or footprint
- 🦾 **Hardened** – reliable under load, even in high-noise environments

## 🧪 Usage

Run as Administrator to capture full telemetry:

```bash
GhostWatch.exe

For triage, it supports plug-and-run execution from external drives or live forensic OS environments.

📤 Output Example
[!] Suspicious mapping: PID 2084 [brave.exe]
[*] ALERT: Section creation detected (PID 2436)
[+] Event: CreateRemoteThread in PID 3421
[+] NtWriteVirtualMemory → PID 1324
Operator-grade output. Clean, readable, exportable.

GhostWatch doesn’t scan — it hunts.
Built for those who track what others ignore.
